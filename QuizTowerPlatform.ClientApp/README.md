# DAX WebAppClient (Angular SPA)

This project is the **frontend** of the DAX WebAppServer — part of the **DAX (Distributed Architecture eXamples)** ecosystem. It is a modular single-page application built with Angular and served via the YARP-powered BFF layer.

The app communicates securely with:
- **DAX IdentityServer** for authentication
- **DAX Backend API** for protected resources
